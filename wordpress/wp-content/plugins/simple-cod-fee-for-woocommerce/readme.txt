This plugin will add a custom fee for Cash On Delivery payment method in WooCommerce. It is a very simple plugin with only two options. Fee amount and Fee title (what the user will see as explanation for the extra charge).

== Description ==
Most of the times real Cash On Delivery payment methods charge an amount of money. WooCommerce by default doesn't have the option to add this extra fee to the user. With this plugin you can easily do just that.

== Screenshots ==
1. Only two simple options, fee and label
2. How the options are shown in frontend
3. Different cod fee for each shipping method
4. Different cod fee for each currency per shipping method

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where can I find the settings? =
Now the settings can be found under the menu Woocommerce > COD Settings. In WooCommerce COD payment gateway settings you will also find a link to this page.
= Can I enable Cash on Delivery for specific shipping options? =
Of course, this is a native WooCommerce function. Under WooCommerce settings you can add the shipping options under the option "Enable for shipping methods"
= How can I add different cod fees per shipping method?
Simply click the "Different fees per shipping method?" option and all the shipping methods that are enabled for COD will be displayed allowing you to add specific prices for each one.
= Does this plugin work with WPML and multiple currencies?
Yes, if you use WPML and have multicurrency support enabled, you can now have multiple COD fee per currency.
= Can I adjust COD Fee in main currency and then use the exchange rates to automatically adjust other currencies?
Yes, from version 2.0 onwards, you can find a new option in the settings menu called "Use exchange rates?". Enable this option will let you only enter the price for the cod fee in the main currency, and all other currencies ara automatically calculated during checkout.
= Does this plugin offers an option to Disable COD or COD Fee depending on user's cart subtotal?
Yes, you can configure this plugin to completely disable COD or just the COD Fee depending on user's total amount in cart
= I am a developer, can I manipulate the final fee before it show up in the cart?
Yes you can use filter **`scffw_cod_fee`** which take as parameters the fee and the cart, so you can manipulate the fee cost as you wish
